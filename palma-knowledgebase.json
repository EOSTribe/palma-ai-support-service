          "answer": "ERC20 is the token standard on the Ethereum blockchain, while TRC20 is the standard on the TRON blockchain. The main differences include: 1) Transaction fees - ERC20 typically has higher fees, 2) Confirmation time - TRC20 is usually faster, 3) Security aspects - ERC20 is considered more established. Always ensure the sender and receiver are using the same network.",

          "answer": "Transaction times vary by network: 1) ERC20 (Ethereum) transactions typically take between 30 seconds to several minutes, depending on network congestion and the gas fee paid, 2) TRC20 (TRON) transactions are usually faster, taking approximately 15-30 seconds. These times are for blockchain confirmations, not including time needed to prepare and sign transactions.",

          "id": "transaction-05",
          "question": "What are transaction fees and how do they work?",
          "answer": "Transaction fees are payments to blockchain network validators who process transactions. 1) For ERC20 (Ethereum), fees are called 'gas fees' and can vary significantly based on network congestion, 2) For TRC20 (TRON), fees are typically much lower and more stable. Palma Wallet displays the expected fee before you confirm a transaction, allowing you to make an informed decision.",

          "answer": "For long-pending transactions: 1) Check the network status - high congestion can delay processing, 2) For ERC20 transactions, the gas fee might be too low during high demand periods, 3) Verify your internet connection is stable, 4) Wait for blockchain confirmation - sometimes it takes longer during peak periods, 5) If the problem persists for more than a few hours, contact support with your transaction details.",

          "question": "I sent funds to the wrong address. Can I get them back?",
          "answer": "Unfortunately, blockchain transactions are irreversible once confirmed. If you sent funds to an incorrect address: 1) If you know the recipient, contact them directly to request a return transaction, 2) If you sent to an exchange or service, contact their customer support, 3) If you sent to a random address, recovery is generally not possible. Always double-check addresses before confirming transactions.",

          "id": "tech-02",
          "question": "How does Palma Wallet verify transaction signatures?",
          "answer": "Palma Wallet verifies signatures using public key cryptography: 1) When a transaction is created, a digital signature is generated using the sender's private key, 2) The signature, along with the transaction data, is sent to the server, 3) The server retrieves the user's public key from the database, 4) Using cryptographic verification algorithms, the server confirms that the signature is valid for the transaction data and could only have been created by the holder of the corresponding private key, without ever needing access to the private key itself.",

          "answer": "Palma Wallet uses AWS (Amazon Web Services) for its backend infrastructure. User data is stored in DynamoDB tables, with the region set to af-south-1 (Cape Town). The architecture includes serverless components with Lambda functions handling transaction processing and user data management. User private keys are never stored on the server - only public keys are stored to verify transaction signatures.",

          "id": "tech-04",
          "question": "How does key generation work in Palma Wallet?",
          "answer": "Key generation in Palma Wallet has evolved with different versions: 1) Initial version used RSA cryptography with fallback mechanisms if RSA wasn't available, 2) Latest version uses FIO Protocol for key generation, where random bytes are generated as a seed, then processed through cryptographic functions to create a private key, from which a public key is derived. This approach ensures secure, collision-resistant key pairs unique to each user.",
