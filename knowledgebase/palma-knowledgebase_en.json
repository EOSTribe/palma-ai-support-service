If you sent funds to an incorrect address: 1) If you know the recipient, contact them directly to request a return transaction, 2) If you sent to an exchange or service, contact their customer support, 3) If you sent to a random address, recovery is generally not possible.

          "answer": "Palma Wallet verifies signatures using public key cryptography: 1) When a transaction is created, a digital signature is generated using the sender's private key, 2) The signature, along with the transaction data, is sent to the server, 3) The server retrieves the user's public key from the database, 4) Using cryptographic verification algorithms, the server confirms that the signature is valid for the transaction data and could only have been created by the holder of the corresponding private key, without ever needing access to the private key itself.",

The architecture includes serverless components with Lambda functions handling transaction processing and user data management. User private keys are never stored on the server - only public keys are stored to verify transaction signatures.",

          "question": "How does key generation work in Palma Wallet?",
          "answer": "Key generation in Palma Wallet has evolved with different versions: 1) Initial version used RSA cryptography with fallback mechanisms if RSA wasn't available, 2) Latest version uses FIO Protocol for key generation, where random bytes are generated as a seed, then processed through cryptographic functions to create a private key, from which a public key is derived. This approach ensures secure, collision-resistant key pairs unique to each user.",
